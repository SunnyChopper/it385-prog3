Upon receiving the letter reporting your uncle's demise and reviewing the king's decree, you quickly pack up your meager worldy belongings and set out for Beauxgardens in the far east of the kingdom.
     While ruling lands is not the occupation you once envisioned for yourself, it does seem a more secure provision than any your deceased parents had been able to arrange.  Certainly a place that had earned the name Beauxgardens would be a rewarding responsibility and would soon return to the productivity the king expected if well cared for.  And who could complain about being named a Baron out of the blue?
     Thus, you find yourself at an inn a half-day away from your destination with a light heart despite the fatigues of travel. Undaunted even by the odd looks of the innkeeper, you cover the last few miles to your new home by foot, since no paid coach can be obtained and your prior means did not extend to owning a horse.
