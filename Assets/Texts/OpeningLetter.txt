My dear Alan,
     I am afraid that I must impart some difficult news.  As you know, your Uncle George chose to respond to the king's challenge to battle the dragon known as Sangamon the Red, hoping to win the promised castle and lands.
     George was successful in his quest and defeated the dragon.  Unfortunately, I know that you will be deeply grieved to hear that he was overcome by the wounds sustained in the battle and has passed away. 
     However, the news is not all bleak.  The king has determined that the prize lands and castle are to be bestowed upon you, as George's sole remaining heir.  You are to take possession of Beauxgardens and the surrounding county immediately as detailed in the enclosed decree.
     I know that you will make the most of this unexpected opportunity.
Your eternal friend,
Maria
