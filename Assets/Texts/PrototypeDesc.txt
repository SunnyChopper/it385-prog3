Welcome to my town simulator prototype.  The primary purpose of the prototype is to get basic systems functioning.  

At this point, you can create roads, houses, wells, farms, and stores.  
You can also delete any of the above by selecting the delete button and then clicking on the item you wish to delete.  Note that the center of the x should be over the base of the item to delete.  

People will come to inhabit the houses. 

Walkers will emerge from the wells to distribute water to the houses.  

The farms will "grow" by changing colors and eventually send their goods to any stores with storage space available.  

People will go from houses to stores to collect the goods from the stores if they already have water.  

Houses will become darker blue as the "level up," first by having inhabitants, then by having water available, and finally by having food as well as water.  

The interface and "art" are extremely simple, since my goal was to focus on getting the simple system working.  

Any feedback would be welcome.
